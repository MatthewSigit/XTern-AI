# XTern-AI-Prompt

This is a repository written for XTern AI (2023).

For Readers: 

Written work is in the folder under the name "Explanations and Thought Processes". I wrote most of my thought process that I had. This includes my thoughts during data visualization and analysis, answers to the written questions and why I chose a specific model (KNN) to create a machine learning model.

All graphs that I have and reference are in the "Raw Data Visualization and Code" folder. There, I have:
- My code on a jupyter notebook that created all the graphs.
- A copy of the data set
- All pdfs created through the use of the python pandas module

The data model that I have created is stored in the folder "ML Model".





Prompt:

Given the launch of our food truck line, FoodX, we will be running an exciting and interactive promotion on college campuses to attract a massive initial student following.  When placing their order on our fancy new FoodX app they input basic information about their college experience and we predict what they are going to order.  If we donâ€™t get it right they get a 10% discount. While the promotion has done a great job of bringing in business our staff has not been great at guessing orders and are not happy with the combined workload of guessing and cooking.

Because of this you have been asked to consider implications, solutions and deployment of a mechanism to automatically guess orders, sounds like the perfect job for AI!

Objectives:

Given the data set, do a quick exploratory data analysis to get a feel for the distributions and biases of the data.  Report any visualizations and findings used and suggest any other impactful business use cases for that data.

Consider implications of data collection, storage, and data biases you would consider relevant here considering Data Ethics, Business Outcomes, and Technical Implications

Discuss Ethical, Technical and Business outcome implications of these factors

Build a model to predict a customers order from their available information.

Outline your process for model selection, training and testing. Including data preparation.
Design a function that prepares your data by loading the provided dataset and processes it into an appropriate machine readable format if necessary.
Design a function to train your model and pickle it.
Train and test your model.  Submit any training, testing and model selection visuals or metrics.
